## R Markdown
### This is a level 3 header
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
Here is a link to [GOOGLE](https://www.google.com/)

Here is a word in **bold** and another word in __bold__.

Here is a word in *italics* and another word in _italics_.

When we compile our document, we are using the `rmarkdown` package.

When we compile we use `Rmarkdown`

Here are some example R commands:

```
2+2
mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))
```

### Non-numbered list
Here is an example of a non-numbered list:

* Breakfast
    - food
      + eggs
      + toast
      + bacon
    - drink
        + apple juice
* Lunch
    - taco
* Dinner
    - baked chicken
    - broccoli
    - rice

### Numbered list

Here is an example of a numbered list:

1. Breakfast
    a. food
        i. eggs
        ii. toast
        iii. bacon
    b. drink
        i. apple juice
2. Lunch
    a. taco
3. Dinner
    a. baked chicken
    b. broccoli
    c. rice

### Blockk quote

Here is an example of a blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
> 2. Second item.


### Block quote - with italics

Here is an example of a blockquote:

>*This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.*
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
> 2. Second item.

>*Like this?*

### Nested Blockquote


Here is an example of a nested blockquote:

> This is a block quote. This
> paragraph has two lines.
>
> > This text is nested

## Code Blockquote

Here is an example of code in a blockquote:

>     2+2
>     mean(c(1,2,3,4,5))




When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r pressure2, fig.height=5, fig.width=5}
plot(pressure)
```

## Insert Tables

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars))
```
## Quick regression

```{r}
require(stats); require(graphics)
plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (mph)", ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)",
     las = 1)
lines(lowess(cars$speed, cars$dist, f = 2/3, iter = 3), col = "red")
title(main = "cars data")
plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (mph)", ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)",
     las = 1, log = "xy")
title(main = "cars data (logarithmic scales)")
lines(lowess(cars$speed, cars$dist, f = 2/3, iter = 3), col = "red")
summary(fm1 <- lm(log(dist) ~ log(speed), data = cars))
opar <- par(mfrow = c(2, 2), oma = c(0, 0, 1.1, 0),
            mar = c(4.1, 4.1, 2.1, 1.1))
plot(fm1)
par(opar)
```

## Back to Tables

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars), caption = "Top Six Rows of Data Set")
```

## Insert Equation

$$
Y=\beta_0 + \beta_1X
$$
